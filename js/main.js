Scope
- Study the code bellow and answer the following without checking the console.
- Are the variables what they claim to be?
- What would console.log(y) and console.log(x) print? Why?
- Write you answer bellow the code.
**************************************************************************************/
(function(){
  "use strict";

  var x = "I'm a local variable";
  //console.log(y)

  function scopeThis(){
    var y = "I'm a global variable";
    console.log(x);
  }
  scopeThis();
})();
/*************************************************************************************
------------ ANSWER -------------------
1. The variables are not what they claim to be. X is a global variable since it is declared outside of the function, y is a local variable declared inside the function.
2. Y would print undefined, since y is declared inside the scopeThis function and called outside of it, while X will print 'I'm a local variable' because it was declared as a global variable.

- Study the code bellow and answer the following without checking the console.
- What would console.log(x) and console.log(y) print? Why?
- Write you answer bellow the code.
**************************************************************************************/
(function(){
  "use strict";

  function warmUp() {
    console.log(x);
    console.log(foo());

    var x = "variable hosting!";

    function foo() {
      return "function hoisting";
    }
  }
  warmUp();
})();
/*************************************************************************************
------------ ANSWER -------------------
Console.log(x) will print undefined, because the var x is declared after it is being called and a variable must be declared first before being called. Console.log(y) will print undefined because 'y' is never declared anywhere above and console.log(y), is not written anywhere. Console.log(foo()) however, would return 'function hoisting' because it doesn't matter that the function is declared after the console.log(foo()).

Date Object
- Declare a variable 'todayIs'.
- Using the date constructor, it should print today's date.
**************************************************************************************/

(function(testerOne){
  "use strict";
  //YOUR CODE HERE
  let todayIs = new Date();

  console.assert(todayIs == today, "#3 Test failed. Did you set the date correctly?");
})(testerOne);

//  TEST DOESNT WORK





/**************************************************************************************
# 4
Warm up
- Study the code below. What will console.log(add) (inside the IFEE and outside) print? Why? Write your answer below.
- Do not uncomment console.log(add);
**************************************************************************************/
(function() {
  "use strict";
  const add = 2 + 2;
  //console.log(add);
})();
//console.log(add);
/**************************************************************************************
------------ ANSWER -------------------
The console.log(add) inside the IFEE will print 4, while the one outside of the IFEE will print undefined because the 'add' variable is is within the scope of the function while it is trying to be called outside of the function.

Object notation

- Using dot notation, do the following:
  - add a property of "sauceType" with a value of "tomato".
  - add a property of "protien" with a value of "chicken".
  - add a propety of "orderNow" with a value of that would make it pass the assertion.
  - add a property of "sauce" with a value of that would make it pass the assertion.
- Fix hoisting issues
- It should return, "We are making your pizza with tomato and chicken. Pickup in 20 minutes.".

Object notation
- Study the code below, line by line, carefully. Keep hoisting and scope in mind.
- Add the following properties to 'benefit' using bracket notation:
  - "credit" with a value of 50.
  - "discount" with a value of 5.
- Complete the missing return statement.
- 'name' must be set to 'James' as a local variable in one of the functions. It should also change the global variable in order for the assertion to pass.
-It should return: "Hello James. Here is the status of your account. Thank you for your loyalty. You've been a member for 18 months . You next bill will reflect a $50 credit and a 5% discount going forward."
HINTS:
- Don't be overwhelmed by the length of the function. Read the instructions carefully. Read it line by line, keeping hoisting and scope in mind. You've got this.
- First fix hoisting issues.
- One of the variables is missing something.
- Are the functions being called when they are supposed to?
